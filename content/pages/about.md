I like camera, coffee, books, tennis and cookies&cream ice cream. 

I have a keen insterest in cybersecurity, expecially web-security. I'm currently working in a research lab on testing security of Agentic AI systems. Apart from going down the internet rabbit-hole, I like to work on solving some port-swigger labs. CUrrently trying to get Comptia Security+ Certification.
